## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

with this challenge i learned how to use the checkbox/radio trick to display/hide some text without using javascript,

```css
.accordion_input:checked ~ .accordion_label .accordion_text {
  display: block;
}
```

-by the way i got a lot of difficulty with logos display, still not finishing to place them correctly yet, it's quite frustrating to don't find the proper solution...
